### Qualitative analysis of mangrove response to drivers of change

TODO:: 
- Clean up code and make scenario simulation more efficient! purrrr....
-	Process data for missing for typologies
-	Maple/loop analyst, which loops drive ambiguity?
o	Although Ward (2021) says symbolic analysis is powerful for identifying feedbacks, and is difficult to carry out for models with more than five nodes

In the scripts folder you will find:

1. 01_scenarios-outcomes.R: a script to simulate scenarios and plot probability of predicted outcomes

2. 02_scenarios-plots.R: plot the scenario results

3. 03_mapping.R: map models to mangrove typologies

4. helpers.R: a script with helper functions

5. models.R: a script that builds different conceptual models for testing
