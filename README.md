### Qualitative analysis of mangrove response to drivers of change

In the scripts folder you will find:

1. one-model-rule-all_v2.Rmd: An rmarkdown with some exploratory analyses including:
    a. Build and visualise conceptual models
    b. Calculate and compare model evidence under different validation scenarios
    c. Probability of mangrove increase or decrease under different scenarios
    d. For each scenario, get models that are valid, construct probability distribution of likely parameter values
  
2. scenarios-outcomes.R: a script to simulate scenarios and plot probability of predicted outcomes

3. helpers.R: a script with helper functions

4. models.R: a script that builds different conceptual models for testing
